# Apriori-Practice

Steps-
Created a list of grocery items
used TransactionEncoder(list into array)
Converted the array into DataFrame
Using Apriori-generated frequent_itemsets
Using Association_rules generated rules

#Goal
It will help the storekeeper to align the items in such a manner that more items will be bought together by the Cx's-to achieve more profit
It will also help to retain/get the stock before the item gets finished in the mart/store(to avoid the shortage of any frequently buying items in the store)
